## Project 5: Heart Disease Prediction

Credit: Dataset imported from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset).
Dataset Information:
The data is from 1988 from four different databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. There are 76 total attributes however all published papers refer to these 14 subset of attributes. Integer value 0 = no disease 1 = disease
* age
* sex
* chest pain type (4 values)
* resting blood pressure
* serum cholestoral in mg/dl
* fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
* resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
* maximum heart rate achieved
* exercise induced angina
* oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
* thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.

### Types of regression models used for classification:
1. Logistic Regression

### Conclusion:
After building our regression model, we build a prediction model and test that prediction with certain features.
